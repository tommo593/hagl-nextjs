      <p>
        We are an online estate agency dedicated to helping the average joe,
        take back control of the sale of their property. To us, it's criminal
        that estate agents can artificially inflate the price of your house,
        costing you and your buyer more money whilst lining their own pockets.
        Hagl offers an end-to-end service, giving you all parties transparency
        from start to finish!
